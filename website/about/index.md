My name is Jasmin Rubinovitz.    
I'm currently a Research Assistant and a Graduate Student in the Viral Communications group @ the MIT Media Lab.  
Perior to that I was a software engineer at Google, and studied ceramic design at Bezalel Academy For Art and Design and Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  
I'm interested in computer human interactions and the relations between our day to day life, art and design, and developed technology.  

I'm taking ["How To Make (Almost) Anything"](../../../../) in fall 2015 and this site documents the things I'm making in that class.
